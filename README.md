# Keyboard-Teacher
This project teaches _**italian QWERTY keybord's usage**_. It is really useful because a lot of people don't know __*how to use a keyboard*__, and tend to look away from the screen, to look at the keyboard, and commit lots of **_mistakes_**. This program teaches how to use **_all 10 finger_** to  write a text to the computer. This technique increases your writing speed, reduces the number of mistakes done while typing and **_increases your efficiency_**. To get started just download the project and open the **_KeyBoard-Teacher_** program. Then you have to choose the difficulty (*Easy*-*Medium*-*Hard*) and start typing. If you have any problem, just write in the **[__ISSUES__](https://github.com/Prometal328/Keyboard-Teacher/issues)** part of this repository.
